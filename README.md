Alien Annihilator - Space Invaders-esque Game in Vanilla JavaScript

I was tasked to build a game for module 1 'Front End Development' at General Assembly. I chose to build Alien Annihilator - Space Invaders-esque Game. It is based on a classic arcade game, now implemented in vanilla JavaScript! Play as a spaceship and annihilate the aliens before they shoot you or get to your part of the screen.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
* A web browser (e.g. Google Chrome)

Installing
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
3. Start playing!

Game Play
* Move the spaceship left or right using the arrow keys.
* Fire missiles at the aliens using the spacebar.
* Avoid the alien missiles and destroy all the aliens to advance in the game and score points.
* If your spaceship is hit by an alien missile, you lose a life. The game is over when you lose all your lives.
* Earn points for each alien destroyed.

Game Mechanics

The game mechanics behind the Space Invaders game are as follows:
* The player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, and the objective is to defeat the aliens moving across the screen from top to bottom and left to right.
* The player can move the spaceship left or right and shoot the aliens by firing missiles.
* The aliens move across the screen and fire missiles at the player's spaceship.
* The player must avoid the alien missiles and destroy all the aliens to advance to the next level.
* If the player's spaceship is hit by an alien missile, the player loses a life. The game is over when the player loses all their lives.
* The player earns points for each alien destroyed


Built With
* Vanilla JavaScript - The language used to implement the game logic, graphics, and user input.
* HTML5 Canvas - The technology used to display the game graphics.
* CSS

The index.html file is the main HTML file that defines the structure and content of the web page for the Space Invaders game. It includes the following elements:
* A canvas element to display the game graphics.
* CSS is included within the html file to style the page
* A link to the JavaScript file scripts/app.js to handle the game logic and user input.

I have also included
* The styling for the canvas to define its size and position on the page.
* The styling for the game elements, such as the spaceship and the aliens, to define their appearance and position.

The app.js file contains the main JavaScript code for the game. It implements the game mechanics and logic, including the following:
* Initialization of the game elements, such as the spaceship and the aliens.
* Movement of the spaceship and the aliens.
* Collision detection between the spaceship and the aliens, as well as between the missiles fired by the spaceship and the aliens.
* Scoring and tracking the player's lives.
* Detection of the game over conditions, such as when the player loses all their lives or destroys all the aliens.
* Handling of user input, such as moving the spaceship and firing missiles.
The code in these files uses vanilla JavaScript, with no external libraries, to handle the game logic, graphics, and user input.
